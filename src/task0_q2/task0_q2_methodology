My approach was to just make 3 nodes in a package, and connect them using 2 topics. \
Multiplication between my number (which was Int64 type) and 10 (which is regular int) was not working so I had to convert 10 to Int64. \
Then I found out that Int64 is a class that has an integer value inside it, so I just dealt with those values instead and for publishing to topic2, I converted the data back to Int64
