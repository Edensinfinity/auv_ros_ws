I first just copied what was there in previous question with the necessary changes to package names.\
Then, I added edge detection functionality, by converting to a grayscale image called gray, running cv2.Canny(gray, 100, 200), then converting back to a colour image.\
Then, I found out that I could send the image as an Image type by importing it from sensor_msgs.msg \
So, I changed the code to a ROS format, adding in the rosnode and publisher, etc.\
I tried publishing the frame directly, but that didnâ€™t work.\
I found out that I had to use CVBridge, to convert the frame to a ROS Image Message.\
Then, I made the subscriber node, and used CVBridge again to convert the ROS Image Message back into a CVimage which I could then show using the same commands as luxonis_task_q1.
